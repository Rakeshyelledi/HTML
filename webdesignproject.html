      <h3><b>Tim Berners-Lee</b></h3>

      <p><b>Tim Berners-Lee</b>, a British scientist, invented the World Wide Web (WWW) in 1989, while working at CERN. The web was originally conceived and developed to meet the demand for automated information-sharing between scientists in universities and institutes around the world. ... These actions allowed the web to flourish..</p>

      <h3>Web design timeline :</h3>

      <p><b>1.</b>The World Wide Web (WWW) creator, Tim Berners-Lee launched the world's first website at <b>http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html.</b> Unfortunately. In the year of <b>1991 August 6th</b>, the original website has not been preserved until today and the link shows only its 1992 copy.</p>

      <p><b>2.</b>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an Internet protocol designed to exchange hypertext documents (images, websites, etc.) between the server and the web browser. The first protocol design, later called HTTP v0.9, was created by Tim Berners-Lee in <b>1991 November</b> as part of the WWW service specification. The HTTP v0.9 version was extremely simple, using only the GET method with one parameter, i.e. the name of the requested document.</p>

      <p><b>3.</b>Tim Berners-Lee founded an international organization called World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in the year <b>1994 October 1st</b>. The main objective of the consortium is the development of Web standards for the World Wide Web (WWW). For example, W3C developed standards for HTML, XHML, XML, or CSS markup languages. Another aim of the organization is education and development of Web Accessibility Rules (WCAG).</p>

      <p><b>W</b>eb development is the work involved in developing a Web site for the Internet <b>(World Wide Web)</b> or an intranet <b>(a private network)</b>.[1] Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex Web-based Internet applications <b>(Web apps)</b>, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.
      Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing <b>markup</b> and <b>coding</b>.[2] Web development may use content management systems <b>(CMS)</b> to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills..</p>

      <p><b>F</b>or larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people <b>(Web developers)</b> and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites. Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds of Web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer. Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers.</p>
